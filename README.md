Amharic Speech-to-Text (ASR) with Wav2Vec2




This repository provides an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system for Amharic built using Facebookâ€™s Wav2Vec2.0 model fine-tuned on Amharic speech datasets. The project aims to make Amharic speech recognition accessible and open-source, supporting low-resource language research and real-world applications.
